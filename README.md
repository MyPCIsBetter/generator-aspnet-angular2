# ASP.net Core Angular 2 Yeoman generator

> Starter kit for all who want to use ASP.net Core with Angular 2

Welcome to ASP.net Core Angular 2 template!

## What do you need to know: ##

[This README contains solutions for possible problems after scaffolding new project](https://github.com/MyPCIsBetter/generator-aspnet-angular2/blob/master/generators/app/templates/src/Angular2Template/README.md)

### Used technologies: ###

* ASP.net Core (with WebAPI) - for backend management
* Angular 2 (RC 4) - for frontend management
* TypeScript - because it works much better with Angular than pure JS
* Gulp - for all automation
* Bootstrap - for better appearance

### Other important information about template: ###

* `wwwroot` folder is treated like temporary file. What that means is: what's inside is build by Gulp and can be deleted at any time without causing damage. Don't make any changes there!
* All code that you make is safely stored in `src` folder.
* Routing is party done by ASP.net and partly by Angular. If ASP.net doesn't recongnize path, it loads index.html file with angular inside.
