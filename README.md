## Installation

You'll also need [Yeoman](http://yeoman.io/)

> npm install -g yo

## What do you need to make project work

1. [ASP.net Core](https://www.microsoft.com/net/core#windows) because it's .net core project
2. [Node.JS](https://nodejs.org/en/) because it's used in building process
3. [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/) to install yeoman and this generator
4. [Gulp](https://github.com/gulpjs/gulp) (just install it globally)
5. Node scripts like `npm`, `gulp`, `bower` need to work globally in console. [This is how you can do it.](https://github.com/piotrek-k/generator-dotnetcore-angular2-starterkit/blob/master/generators/app/templates/src/Angular2Template/README.md#if-commands-like-npm-bower-gulp-doesnt-work-globally-in-your-console)

## Generating new project
